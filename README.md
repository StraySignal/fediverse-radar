This tool intakes your followed users export from mastodon and checks to see if they have a corrosponding bridged account using [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/)

Usage:
```node mastoToBsky.js <name of mastodon following accounts.csv>```

I also included a tool to just print out the resulting ```output.csv``` to an HTML page for ease of clicking.

It's used by running
```node linkPage.js output.csv```


I know this is all very sparse, I will make it prettier in time I promise
